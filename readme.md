### Homepage of Benjamin P. Mullins

My young son, Benjamin, decided that he simply had to have a website.

### Implementation

Super simple. It's nothing but a few lines of Javascript and a bunch of HTML, CSS, and image files. Created on macOS (10.14) with BBEdit and hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
